Financial literacy requirements vary widely from state to state.

## Snapshot of State Mandates
- **Florida:** Standalone half-credit course required for graduation.
- **Missouri:** Integration into social studies curriculum.
- **California:** No statewide mandate; implementation varies by district.

## Observations
States with standalone requirements see higher student competency scores, but integration models can be equally effective if well-resourced.

## Conclusion
A national standard could help close gaps and ensure every student graduates with essential financial skills.
