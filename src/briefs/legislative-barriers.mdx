While many states support financial literacy in principle, legislative obstacles remain.

## Common Barriers
1. **Funding Constraints:** Limited budgets for new curricula.
2. **Competing Mandates:** Pressure to prioritize other academic requirements.
3. **Political Gridlock:** Slow legislative processes delaying implementation.

## Recommendations
- Build bipartisan coalitions.
- Secure dedicated funding streams.
- Align financial literacy standards with existing educational frameworks.

## Conclusion
Addressing these barriers is critical to making financial literacy education a standard in all U.S. high schools.
